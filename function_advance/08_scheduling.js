// What does "scheduling" a call mean? In js how many methods are there for scheduling a call? are they part of js specs?

//* setTimeout
// what does setTimeout do? how we pass arguments in setTimeout?

// if the first argument of setTimeout is a string then what happened? is it recommended? what should we use instead?

// if we pass function call as the first setTimeout argument then what happened?

// What setTimeout returns? What data type is it in browser and is it same on all environment? Where can we use it? What does clearTimeout do?

// when we pass a method what 'this' keyword is used, separately from object in setTimeout, what is the value of 'this' become?

//* setInterval
// what does setInterval do? what arguments it accept?

// What does setInterval return? what does clearTimeout do?

// when setInterval run the function does the timer goes on when the function is running? is the time among multiple function calls is same when using setInterval?

//* nested setTimeout
// What does nested setTimeout do? How to create a nested setTimeout?

// is nested setTimeout more flexible than setInterval? how?

// is nested setTimeout guarantees fixed delay between each function call?

// ========================================================================

// how garbage collection work for setTimeout or setInterval? Why we should always clear scheduled function?

// When the scheduler function run?

// What actually happened if the delay is 0 in a browser? What happened to interval after 5 nested timers? Why does this limitation exist now? Is this limitation exist for server side js?
