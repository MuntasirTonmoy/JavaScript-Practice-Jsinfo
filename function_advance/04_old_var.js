// difference between var vs let?

// variable declare with var are what scope? how var works with block scope?

// if a code block inside a function contain var variable what is it's scope?

// can we redeclare same name variable with var?

// how can we use var variable before its declaration? when var declaration are processed?

// in the past when there was only var, how block scope is being achieved?

// what are other ways to create IIFE? why it is called function expression?
