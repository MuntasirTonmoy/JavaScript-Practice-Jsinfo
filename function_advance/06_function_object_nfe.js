// in js, function is what type of value? callable 'action object'

// can we treat function as object?

// if we declare a function what's the value of function.name property? does object method have name property too?

// what does contextual naming mean? how function.name value is assigned? If there is no way to get the name of the function then whats the value for function.name?

// what's the value for function.length property? is function.length count rest param? where function.length property is used?

// can we add custom properties to function? does function properties creates a local variable inside it?

// can function properties be an alternative for closure? what's the difference between them?

// What is NFE? use case of NFE? self reference, not visible outside.

// when can't we reference a function expression by its variable name?

// is internal function name available for function declaration? if we need a internal name what can we do?
