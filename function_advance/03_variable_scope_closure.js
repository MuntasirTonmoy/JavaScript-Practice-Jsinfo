// what is block scope? if a variable declared inside a code block where will it be visible? use case of block scope.

// if we declare variable inside the {} of 'if', 'for', 'while' etc. where those variable are visible?

// for(let i = 5; i < 10; i++){} here we can see variable i is declared outside of block {}, where will it be visible?

// What is a nested function? when we create a nested function can we access variable declared in the outer function?

// When we return a nested function and use the returned function elsewhere can it still access the outer function variable? How it works?

// What is lexical environment? how many parts lexical environment has? What each part do?
