// What is map? difference between Map and object?

// How to create a new Map with values?

// How to store key, value in Map? Map.set return what? How can we store multiple key, values using Map chain?

// How to get a value by the key? what is returned if the key doesn't exist?

// How to test if the Map has a key or not?

// How to remove a key, value pair from the Map? How to clear the whole Map?

// How to see the Map size, meaning the current element count in a Map?

// Why we shouldn't use map[key] = value; like that?

// What is the most notable Map feature?

// How Map compare keys? Can we use NaN as a Map key?

// How can we loop over a Map? What is returned by Map.keys(), values(), entries()? by default if we use map in for..of loop what iteration method is used?

// Does Map iteration goes through the value insertion order? Does Map preserves the value insertion order?

// Does Map has a built in forEach method similar to array?

// How can we convert an object into Map?

// How can we convert a Map into Object?

// What is set? What is the main feature of a Set?

// How to create a Set ?

// How to add value to a Set? If we add multiple same value to the Set, what happened?

// How to delete a value from the Set? How to clear the whole Set?

// How to test if a value exist in the Set?

// How to count the total number of element in a Set?

// Can we use for..of or forEach(value, valueAgain, set) to iterate over a Set? Why the valueAgain is used here?

// What does set.keys(), set.values(), set.entries() return?
