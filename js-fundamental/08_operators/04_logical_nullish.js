// what are the logical operators in js? why they used for?

// if an operand isn't boolean is it coerced to boolean value?

//* OR (||)
// how OR operator works? is is often used to test what?

// for multiple condition how OR operator work? what it finds first and what it returns?

// if all the condition evaluated (i.e all were false) what does OR return?

// how the value is returned? does OR operator return converted boolean value or original value?

// why OR operator mostly used. fallback value, short circuit.

//* AND (&&)
// how AND operator work?

// for multiple condition how AND operator work? what it find first and what it returns?

// if all the condition evaluated what does AND return?

// how the value is returned? does AND operator return converted value or original value?

//* NOT (!)
// How not operator works?

// When !! double not operator used?

// what operator precedence is higher AND, OR, NOT? (NOT > AND > OR, Nullish)

//* Nullish (??)
// How nullish operator works? what does it return? can we use a sequence of nullish operator?

// How we can rewrite nullish operator using other operators?

// what is the common use case for nullish operator?

// what is the difference between OR vs nullish operator?

// what operator precedence is higher? nullish or OR?

// why we need to add parenthesis when use nullish with other higher precedence operator ?

// can we use nullish operator with AND(&&), OR(||) operator together? if we want to use that how can we do that?

//* Logical OR Assignment(||=)
// How logical or assignment works? Logical or assignment short circuits, what does it mean?

// use case of logical OR assignment.

//* Logical AND Assignment(&&=)
// How logical and assignment works? Logical and assignment short circuits, what does it mean?

//  use case of logical AND assignment.

//* Logical Nullish Assignment(??=)
// How logical nullish assignment works? Logical nullish assignment short circuits, what does it mean?

// use case of logical nullish assignment.
