// how to run js code in node.js?
// where can we put <script> tag and how the js program inside the <script> tag execute?

// -  can be inserted almost anywhere, automatically executed when the browser processes the tag

// "type" attribute in <script> tag. what does it means now? in HTML4 why does the type attribute is being used?
// why does "language" attribute is used?

// why in old time this technique is used <script type="text/javascript"><!-- js code --></script>

// when we use external js script and is there any benefit?
// what type can be the path in src='' attribute

// if the src='' attribute is set does the program inside the <scrip> tag worked or ignored?
