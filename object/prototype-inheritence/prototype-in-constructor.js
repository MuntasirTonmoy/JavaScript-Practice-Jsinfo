// in old days how prototype was used in js?
// If we add a 'prototype' property in a constructor function what does that mean?
// how we set prototype of a newly created object via constructor function?
// when only F.prototype is used?
// is there default prototype property in constructor function? what value does it have?
// how we can use default prototype object constructor property?

// if we replace the default prototype then what happened?
// how should we use prototype so the constructor property doesn't change?
