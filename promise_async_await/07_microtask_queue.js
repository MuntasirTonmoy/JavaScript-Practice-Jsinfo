// Is all promise handler async?

// What is microtask queue? How and when this queue works?

// If a promise is chained with multiple handler how they execute in the queue?

// How JS find out there was an unhandled rejection? When unhandled rejection are generated? When engine triggers the event?

// If we handle an error later setTimeout(() => promise.catch(err => alert('caught')), 1000); then does the unhandled event run?
