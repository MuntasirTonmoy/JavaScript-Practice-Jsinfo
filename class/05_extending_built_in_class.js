// Can we extend built-in class like Map, Array etc?

// When we extend a built in class, built-in methods like filter, map etc. returns new object of what type? How it works? How this feature is useful?

// If special static getter 'Symbol.species' exist in a class what happened? what should be returned by 'Symbol.species'?

// If we would like to built in method return regular Array how can we do that?

// When one class extend another class they inherit both regular and static method, is this same for built-in class?
